# DevOps (Developer Operations)


DevOps enables previously isolated roles —development, IT operations, quality engineering, and security— to coordinate and collaborate to create better, more reliable products. By adopting a DevOps culture along with DevOps practices and tools, teams gain the ability to better respond to customer needs, increase trust in the applications they build, and achieve business goals in less time. 
**DevOps is more...**
- **Culture:** Changing the culture in a company, the desire of both teams to collaborate.
- **Automation:** Being able to replicate infrastructure.  Generate a culture in which both developers and operators automate all their tasks.
- **Measurement:** How long the goals of both teams take. Productivity is measured, how long an API request takes, how long it takes an operator to fix an incident in production, everything is measured.
- **Sharing:** Better internal tools shared by both teams so that the code in production is always in high quality and can be fixed as quickly as possible.
With this, the idea is that one of the results is more deployments that contain fewer features and as a consequence, fewer bugs in production.

# What are DevOps tools?
A DevOps tools approach helps developers and operations teams build, test, deploy and monitor applications with speed, quality and control. Successful DevOps software implementations generally rely on an integrated set of solutions, or a toolchain, to eliminate manual steps, reduce errors, increase team agility, and scale beyond small teams.


# Homogeneous Environments for Applications
One of the ways to solve the "it works in my machine" problem is to have homogeneity in all environments. Running code on our local machine should look as similar as possible to the test and production environment.
## Docker
Docker is recommended, it works for all operating systems (WIN10 Pro only) and is reproducible, we can have an infrastructure that shares everything. The images are reproducible, scriptable and the documentation is in the same code.
