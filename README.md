# DevOps (Developer Operations)


DevOps enables previously isolated roles —development, IT operations, quality engineering, and security— to coordinate and collaborate to create better, more reliable products. By adopting a DevOps culture along with DevOps practices and tools, teams gain the ability to better respond to customer needs, increase trust in the applications they build, and achieve business goals in less time. 
**DevOps is more...**
- **Culture:** Changing the culture in a company, the desire of both teams to collaborate.
- **Automation:** Being able to replicate infrastructure.  Generate a culture in which both developers and operators automate all their tasks.
- **Measurement:** How long the goals of both teams take. Productivity is measured, how long an API request takes, how long it takes an operator to fix an incident in production, everything is measured.
- **Sharing:** Better internal tools shared by both teams so that the code in production is always in high quality and can be fixed as quickly as possible.
With this, the idea is that one of the results is more deployments that contain fewer features and as a consequence, fewer bugs in production.
